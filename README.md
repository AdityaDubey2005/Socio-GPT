## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No OpenAI API key configured"**
- Add your API key to the `.env` file
- Restart the application

**"Failed to load data"**  
- Check that CSV files are in the `data/` folder
- Run the ingestion process: `python -m app.ingest`

**"Chart generation failed"**
- Ensure your data has the required columns
- Try simpler chart requests first

**"Image analysis not working"**
- Install optional dependencies: `pip install pytesseract opencv-python`
- For OCR, install Tesseract: https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/
